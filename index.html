  <p class="articlep">Thanks in part to its many collaborations, the Nike Dunk Low has gradually 
  become one of the most desired silhouettes on the market, most releases selling 
  out near instantly as a result. And though GRs have typically garnered praise for their 
  use of original colors, offerings like the “Community Garden” are still equally notable as 
  fans new and old are enticed by the maximal use of both pattern and color. While a loud colorway 
  at its core, the pair is arguably more interesting for its materials: a set that is not only bold in 
  its dye but also sustainable as it recycles various swatches of canvas. This is why most of the panels 
  are unique to the ones adjacent as the blue, dark purple, and lilac shades are textured with distinct nep; 
  the shapes printed above, however, do seem to be applied towards the end of production as the same reticles 
  and circles are scattered throughout, while lesser used florals, lines, and the like stand unique to their 
  respective sections.</p>
